![App Preview](https://github.com/amarthaid/test-mobile/raw/master/Problem-2/animation.gif)

## Instruction
Create an App using React Native that download message data from Firebase. Show the downloaded messages in a list and add a detail screen that shows the selected message in detail. Please demonstrate how you could solve the problem using Redux.

## Language
Javascript ES6

## Important Notes
1. The App should download the data from [this firebase database](https://rnreduxtest.firebaseio.com/e5d65252-21c8-4030-951f-8a441d886740).
2. Read status should be stored locally
3. Message should be flagged as read once the message is opened
4. Message should be sorted by latest date, and unread messages should be prioritized
5. Unread message count should reflect the number of unread message in local data
6. Show only the excerpt of the messages in list view
